# Problem 314: lambda-expressions-1

In functional programming, a **lambda expression** is an anonymous function.
You are given an array of integers and a sequence of operations. Each operation describes a lambda function that must be applied to every element of the array.
**Supported operations:**
- add x applies f(a) = a + x
- multiply x applies f(a) = a * x
- power x applies f(a) = a to the power of x
- abs applies f(a) = |a|
All operations must be applied in the given order. After applying all lambda expressions, output the final array.

## Input format
The first line contains an integer n (1 <= n <= 10000) - the number of elements.
The second line contains n integers ai (-1000 <= ai <= 1000).
The third line contains an integer q (1 <= q <= 50) - the number of operations.
Each of the next q lines contains one operation in one of the following formats:
```bash
add x
multiply x
power x
abs
```
For operations add x and multiply x: -10 <= x <= 10. For operation power x: 0 <= x <= 10.

## Output format
Print n integers - the resulting array after applying all lambda expressions in order.

## Examples

### Input
5
-1 2 -3 4 5
3
abs
add 2
multiply 2

### Output
9 12 15 18 21

## Notes
Initial array: [-1, 2, -3, 4, 5]
After abs: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
After add 2: [3, 4, 5, 6, 7]
After multiply 3: [9, 12, 15, 18, 21]
