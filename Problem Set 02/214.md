# Problem 214: 395033. Most Frequent Element

Write a program that reads a list of integers into a vector and finds the most frequent element. If there are multiple elements with the same highest frequency, output the smallest among them.

## Input format
The first line contains an integer *N* (1 <= *N* <= 100), representing the number of elements. The next line contains *N* integers, where each integer *x* satisfies -1000 <= *x* <= 1000.

## Output format
A single integer representing the most frequent element. If multiple elements have the same frequency, output the smallest one.
